# Rule Generator for Cursor project rules

When asked to add or update a project rule:

1. **Use `general-rule.mdc` as a formatting reference for tone, structure, and clarity.**
2. Create a new `.mdc` file under `.cursor/rules/`, using **kebab-case** (e.g. `my-new-rule.mdc`).
3. Include frontmatter:
   - `description`: short summary of the rule’s purpose.
   - `globs`: a list of glob patterns targeting files the rule applies to.
   - `alwaysApply`: true/false.
4. Write instructions using Markdown:
   - Use shoulder-level headings (e.g. `# Feature Name`).
   - Provide clear bullet or numbered lists of AI directives.
5. Keep entries concise (<50 lines).
6. Only include relevant fields and avoid legacy format.
7. If asked to update an existing rule, locate the `.mdc` file and modify only that file.
8. **Always place new rule files inside `.cursor/rules/` — never in the root directory or elsewhere.**

**AI behavior:**

– If user says “create a rule for X”, Cursor should:
  - Ask for `description`, `globs`, and instructions if not provided.
  - Generate the proper file with frontmatter and Markdown instructions.
– If user says “update the rule for X”, Cursor should:
  - Identify the file by related `globs` or name.
  - Only change content inside that file.
